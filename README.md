# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
Detection of text and identification of characters in scene images is a challenging
visual recognition problem. As in much of computer vision, the challenges posed by
the complexity of these images have been combated with hand-designed features
and models that incorporate various pieces of high-level prior knowledge.
A simple project done as an assignment for Computer Vision course.


Python programme that help recognising hand written digits using machine learning algorithms.
